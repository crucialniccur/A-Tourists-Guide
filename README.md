### API data
The server contains a list of the counties, each with a unique id, a name, a fun fact and a recommended tourist site.

For now, the data is not complete, meaning not all counties are present but that will change.

### Challenges 
- Getting the county images was a real pain given the common free image sites were not reliable for the first time.
  I  did lean on to [wikimedia commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) where i got the images for the counties.
- Developing the search mechanism to validate that that particular search has no error and matches the one in the server was also a challenge faced.
